# Storage Backends

ArtemisKit supports multiple storage backends for persisting evaluation results. Choose the one that best fits your workflow.

## Available Backends

| Backend | Best For | Persistence |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| [Local](/docs/cli/storage/local/) | Development, single-user | Filesystem |
| [Supabase](/docs/cli/storage/supabase/) | Teams, CI/CD, cloud | PostgreSQL + Storage |

## Configuration

Set the storage backend in your config file:

```yaml
# artemis.config.yaml
storage:
  type: local  # or "supabase"
  basePath: ./artemis-runs
```

Or use environment variables:

```bash
export ARTEMIS_STORAGE_PATH=./artemis-runs
```

## Storage Features

All storage backends support:

- **Save** - Store run manifests with full results
- **Load** - Retrieve a specific run by ID
- **List** - Query runs with filtering and pagination
- **Delete** - Remove runs
- **Compare** - Diff two runs for regression detection

## Run Manifest

Each evaluation run produces a manifest containing:

```typescript
interface RunManifest {
  run_id: string;           // Unique identifier (e.g., "ar-20260115-abc123")
  project: string;          // Project name
  config: {
    scenario: string;       // Scenario filename
    provider: string;       // LLM provider used
    model: string;          // Model used
  };
  metrics: {
    success_rate: number;   // Pass rate (0-1)
    total_cases: number;
    passed_cases: number;
    failed_cases: number;
    median_latency_ms: number;
    p95_latency_ms: number;
    total_tokens: number;
  };
  git: {
    commit: string;
    branch: string;
    dirty: boolean;
  };
  provenance: {
    run_by: string;
    run_reason: string;
  };
  start_time: string;
  end_time: string;
  results: CaseResult[];
}
```

## Choosing a Backend

### Use Local Storage When:

- Developing and testing scenarios
- Running evaluations on a single machine
- You don't need to share results across team members
- Quick setup with zero configuration

### Use Supabase Storage When:

- Running evaluations in CI/CD pipelines
- Collaborating with a team
- Need historical trending and analytics
- Want SQL-queryable results
- Building dashboards or integrations
